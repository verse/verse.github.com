{"tagline":"Network protocol for real-time sharing between graphical applications","body":"## About ##\r\nVerse 2.0 is network protocol for real-time sharing of 3D data. It is successor of old Verse protocol developed at KTH. Keep in mind that Verse 2.0 is still in alpha version.\r\n\r\n## Features ##\r\n\r\nVerse protocol has been designed keeping in mind that this protocol will be used only for real-time sharing of 3D data in applications of virtual reality. There is list of essential features:\r\n\r\n * Client-server architecture\r\n * Effective semi-reliable data transport\r\n  * Low latency\r\n  * UDP connection uses own Flow Control and Congestion Control (TODO)\r\n  * It uses TLS to secure TCP connection and optionally DTLS to secure UDP connection\r\n * Strong user authentication\r\n * Access permissions for shared data\r\n * Locking of shared data\r\n * Support for versing (TODO)\r\n * Generic data mode that could be used for 2D/3D graphics\r\n * C/C++ API\r\n * Python API\r\n * Javascript library using WebSocket (TODO)\r\n\r\n## Contacts ##\r\n\r\n * IRC: irc.freenode.net in channel #verse\r\n * Mailing list: verse-dev@blender.org\r\n * Main developer: Jiri Hnidek\r\n  * E-mail: jiri.hnidek@tul.cz\r\n  * Phone: +420 485 35 3695\r\n  * Address: Studentska 2, 461 17, Liberec 1, Czech Republic\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
